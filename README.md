# BinaryClock
A project to create a binary clock with a home-made circuit-board and a raspberrypi zero

This project contains of two parts:
The circuitboard and the raspberrypi code in python.

The circuit board is a sort of 'hat' to a raspberry pi zero with 20 WS2813B programmable LEDs for the clock-display, a 2x20 header
for the pi connection, a connection for a DS3231 RTC and also an optional connector for a 2x16 display.

I aim to mount this on the back-side of a plexi-glass panel to make a clock that can be mounted on the wall. Pictures and drawings of this 
will also be published when ready.
